# Chatbot-Credit-Card
There is three major goals for this project and one goal if time permits. 
1. Augment a credit card approval dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction) with reasoning for the approval or decline
2. Take that new dataset and finetune llama3 on it to provide the approval/decline and the reason.
3. Build an front end webui to prompt this finetuned model, that includes an API.
4. If time permits another goal is to containizer the front end and push the custom model to huggingface.

## How to use
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
clone https://github.com/DavidN0809/Chatbot-Credit-Card.git
cd Chatbot-Credit-Card
```
### 2. Create and Activate the Environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate CC-Chatbot
```
### 3. Start the Backend
### Navigate to the backend directory and start the Uvicorn server:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
### Test backend using curl
```bash
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/generate/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Test prompt"}'
```
### 4. Start the Frontend
### Navigate to the frontend directory and start the Python HTTP server:
```bash
cd ..
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8080
```

### URLs
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- **FastAPI Docs:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### Git Repository Layout

The repository consists of two main directories: `backend` and `frontend`.

#### **Frontend**
- Contains an HTML file served via the Python HTTP server.

#### **Backend**
- **`notebooks`**: Contains notebooks for fine-tuning and preprocessing.
  - Includes an `outputs` folder for results generated by Papermill.
- **`environment.yml`**: Defines the Conda environment.
- **`main.py`**: Backend script for Uvicorn and FastAPI.
  - Originally converted from the `fast-api-test` notebook.
- **`models`**: Contains classical ML model files.
- **`dataset`**: Includes the original and augmented datasets.
